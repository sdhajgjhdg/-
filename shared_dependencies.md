1. "index.html": This is the main HTML file that will contain the structure of the website. It will include references to the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files. It will contain the id names of the DOM elements that might be used by potential JavaScript functions.

2. "styles.css": This is the main CSS file that will contain custom styles for the website. It will use class and id names that are used in the "index.html" file. It will also import the "tailwind.css" file to use the Tailwind CSS framework.

Shared Dependencies:

1. DOM Element IDs: These are the unique identifiers for the HTML elements in the "index.html" file. They are used in the "styles.css" file to apply specific styles to the elements and could be used by potential JavaScript functions to manipulate the elements.

2. CSS Class Names: These are identifiers for groups of HTML elements in the "index.html" file. They are used in the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files to apply specific styles to the groups of elements.

3. CSS Import: The "tailwind.css" file is imported in the "styles.css" file. This allows the "styles.css" file to use the Tailwind CSS framework.

4. HTML Link: The "styles.css" file is linked in the "index.html" file. This allows the "index.html" file to use the styles defined in the "styles.css" file.

5. Tailwind CSS Classes: These are specific class names provided by the Tailwind CSS framework. They are used in the "index.html" file to apply specific styles to the HTML elements.
